JAVA CONSOLE: TODO LIST APPLICATION FOR JAVA TRAINING
--Project idea provided by ChatGPT so I could learn java and have this repository to refresh the language's syntax and functionalities.--


"Project Idea: Todo List Application 

Description:
Create a console-based Todo List application that allows users to manage their tasks. The application should support adding, removing, and listing tasks, as well as marking tasks as completed.

Key Features:

    Task Class: Create a Task class with properties such as ID, description, due date, and status (completed or not).
    TodoList Class: Implement a TodoList class to manage a list of tasks. Include methods to add tasks, remove tasks, mark tasks as completed, and list all tasks.
    User Input Handling: Use Scanner class to handle user input for adding, removing, and listing tasks.
    Console UI: Design a simple text-based user interface in the console to interact with the Todo List application.
    Data Persistence: Optionally, implement file I/O to save and load tasks from a text file, so that tasks persist between application runs.

Core Concepts Covered:

    Object-oriented programming (classes, objects, methods)
    Collections (ArrayList for managing tasks)
    User input handling (Scanner)
    File I/O (optional)
    Exception handling (e.g., handling invalid user input)
    Documentation (Javadoc comments)

This project allows you to practice core Java concepts such as object-oriented programming, collections, file I/O, and exception handling, while also providing a useful utility for managing tasks. You can start with a simple version of the Todo List application and gradually add more features as you become more comfortable with Java."
